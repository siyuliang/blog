**lost in translation** is a space where I share thoughts on language, travel, and everything in between. 

In my daily life, I work with computers and speech signals. This blog is where I explore the human side of language: moments of miscommunication, cultural encounters, and unexpected connections that come from moving between worlds.

Here you'll find my travel stories, language learning experiences, reflections on fieldwork, and the occasional thoughts I've had along the way.
